# Hackathon-2018
My teammates created this IOS Application during the 2018 Washington State University Hackathon. We set out to create an app the allowed any student to have a personalized website to showcase their resume, for free, without going through the hassle of creating it themselves. I was tasked with creating the IOS application with swift and my teammates wrote the templated HTML/CSS based website.
